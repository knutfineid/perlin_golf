## Perlin golf game
This was the final assignement in the course BMA1020 at NTNU. 
This game got the idea of what I wanted, but the execution is not perfect. Bugs and errors... could have been perfected, but do not have time, maybe some time.

The idea:
  To use perlin noise to get the slope of the green to act on the movement on the ball.
